The original project which can be found [here](https://github.com/ctfrancia/21meals-server) provides excellent documentation on how to get the project up and running, including, photos of how the application looks.

While the original application was written using React and Redux, the application has been maintained as a mobil app, however, [Zain](https://github.com/zain-ali-syed) and myself decided to add additional functionality and make use of Angular7 and Material UI to enrich user experience, while altering very little of the existing back end structure to assist the new front end experience.
